# Portfolio Project

This website serves as a portfolio highlighting my experience, skills, and projects. Originally developed with Angular, Vue.js, Vanilla JavaScript, and React with Next.js, it's now built with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Hosted on Heroku.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: This directory contains all the Astro components used in the project.
- `src/data`: This directory contains TypeScript files that export data used in the project.
- `src/pages`: This directory contains the Astro pages of the portfolio.
- `public`: This directory contains static files served by the portfolio.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Building

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a dist directory with the built assets.
