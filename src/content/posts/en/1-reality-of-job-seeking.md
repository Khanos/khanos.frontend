# The Frustrating Reality of Job Seeking as a Software Engineer

As a software engineer navigating the job market, I've encountered a **frustrating trend** that seems to be on the rise: the proliferation of **staff augmentation sites**. Almost every job posting I come across redirects me to one of these platforms, where the hiring process feels more like **subscribing to a YouTube channel** than applying for a job.

Upon arriving at these sites, I'm bombarded with forms requesting information that I've already meticulously filled out on LinkedIn. It's **redundant** and **time-consuming**, adding unnecessary barriers to the application process.

But the frustrations don't end there. Some of these platforms subject candidates to **lengthy private tests**, purportedly to assess their skills. While assessments can be a valuable part of the hiring process, the **length and invasiveness** of these tests border on absurdity.

Imagine spending **two hours** completing a test, only to find out that you're unable to **copy and paste**, switch tabs, or even exit **full-screen mode**. To add insult to injury, the test requires your **camera and microphone** to be on throughout the entire duration.

This begs the question: Is this really how employers believe developers should work? Are these extreme measures truly necessary to evaluate a candidate's abilities?

For someone like me, hailing from a third-world country where opportunities can be scarce, this experience is not just frustrating; it's **demoralizing**. It feels like yet another barrier erected between talented individuals and meaningful employment opportunities.

In the rapidly evolving world of technology, where innovation is paramount, shouldn't the hiring process reflect a more **progressive and inclusive** approach? Instead of erecting unnecessary hurdles, let's focus on creating pathways that empower candidates to showcase their skills and potential.

It's my **humble opinion** that the current state of job seeking in the tech world is in dire need of reform. Let's work together to create a more **equitable** and **transparent** hiring processâ€”one that values the contributions of all candidates, regardless of their background or geographic location.
