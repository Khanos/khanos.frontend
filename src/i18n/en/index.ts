      <p>I work as a <strong>Frontend Engineer</strong> at <strong>MercadoLibre</strong>, focusing on enhancing the user experience during crucial steps of the purchasing flow. Conducting <strong>in-depth metric analysis</strong> and exploring various approaches, I documented findings to optimize form completion rates, overseeing the implementation process from coding to deployment. Additionally, I contributed to refining personalized templates for the <strong>MercadoShops division</strong>.</p>
      <p>As a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, I spearheaded the creation of the <strong>DerfDice application</strong>, adhering to UI/UX best practices and prioritizing minimalist design for optimal user experience. Crafting diverse dashboards to creatively showcase data, I utilized cutting-edge technologies such as <strong>React, Vue.js, Angular, Astro, jQuery,</strong> and <strong>KnockOut</strong>.</p>
      <p>Transitioning to backend development, I built the <strong>DataCollector tool</strong>, integrating various security protocols to retrieve valuable insights from digital marketing platforms. Storing data in <strong>SQL databases</strong> and utilizing asynchronous jobs for automation, I adopted a <strong>test-driven development approach</strong>, focusing primarily on <strong>Node.js, Express, Sails.js, SQL,</strong> and <strong>NoSQL</strong>.</p>
      <p>As an <strong>Engineer</strong>, I developed a <strong>Monte Carlo simulation tool</strong> for probabilistic distribution forecasting, leveraging open-source technologies like <strong>Python and R</strong>, along with <strong>QooxDoo</strong>. Despite encountering missing requirements, I showcased my mathematical background by delivering the project efficiently.</p>
      <p>Eager for new challenges and ready to embark on the next chapter of my career journey. ‚ú®</p>
